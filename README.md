## ✨ Features  

### 🕊️ Soften Tone  
Uses the **Rewriter API** to rewrite emotionally intense or aggressive text into neutral, balanced language.  
You can apply or revert it anytime — instantly.  

### 📖 Summarize Content  
Uses Chrome’s **Summarizer API** to generate concise and easy-to-understand summaries of web pages.  

### 🧩 Remove Image  
Temporarily hides distracting images and videos. Click again to bring them back.  

### 🎨 Style Optimize *(In Development)*  
Uses the **Prompt API** to suggest calmer, more comfortable color schemes and layouts.  
You can apply or undo these AI-generated styles safely.

## 🧭 How It Works  
MonoMind runs directly in Chrome using its built-in on-device AI models:  
- **Rewriter API** → Tone softening  
- **Summarizer API** → Content simplification  
- **Prompt API** → Visual design optimization  

All processing happens locally, right in your browser.  
✅ **No data leaves your device** — nothing is uploaded or tracked.

## 💡 Example Uses  
- Make intense or emotional articles calmer to read  
- Simplify complex documents or research papers

- Adjust web design for a more soothing experience

## 🔒 Privacy  
MonoMind is **100% local**.  
It does **not collect, send, or store** any user data.  
Everything — rewriting, summarizing, or optimizing — happens within Chrome’s local AI runtime.
